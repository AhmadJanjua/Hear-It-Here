# Hear-It-Here
For our SENG 401 final project, our group decided to develop an online forum application 
platform based on music called Hear It Here. The purpose of our application is to provide a 
forum site that allows users to promote uploaded content using voting and posts. Our website 
allows for discussions about music with topics such as, album discussions, artists news, album 
reviews, song interpretations, etc. This application presents a solution for people who desire to 
communicate with like minded people based on their thoughts and ideas about music. The 
website will be able to perform such goals by utilizing user profiles, upvotes, commenting, 
replies and personal music recommendations. We reflected upon other related products to 
achieve our goal to understand the best practices being used in the industry to promote user 
engagement. With music being a growing industry with multiple evolving ideas and concepts, 
our website will give music fans a chance to share their passions and help build a thriving 
community. The end goal of our project is to create a thriving and active community of music 
lovers for our website to be self-sustained by the users themselves in years to come.
In this documentation we will cover the functional/non-functional requirements that arise when 
developing a music forum site. We will also discuss the architecture and sequence diagrams to 
show how our forum will operate based on components such as the database, google cloud 
server, and the system the user operates. Additionally, the architectures and sequence diagrams 
will be used as a visual layout for users, stakeholders, and developers to discuss and lay out ideas 
based on its structure. Based on these architectures, we will describe aspects of our developed 
website and its different functionalities with their intended purposes. Furthermore, an 
explanation of why OOP was not chosen for the making of this project will be covered in order 
to clarify any confusion of our development. Lastly, to demonstrate the process of figuring out 
bugs and issues within our system, we will go over the test cases that we developed that are tied 
with our functional and non-functional requirements. These tests will also be demonstrated by 
their outcomes to compare the expected results to the systemic response that the forum site 
provides.
